Key Concept:
DOMContentLoaded: This event fires when the HTML document has been fully parsed by the browser. It's often used to ensure code execution happens after the initial page load, preventing errors or unexpected behavior.
new Date(): This function creates a JavaScript Date object containing the current date and time. It's invaluable for tasks like displaying timestamps on posts, managing real-time updates, or scheduling functionality.
createAttribute() and setAttributeNode(): These methods allow you to dynamically create HTML attributes and add them to existing elements. This can be useful for customizing elements based on user input or server-side data.
appendChild(): This method appends a child node (element or text) to the end of the specified parent element's child node list. It's fundamental for building up the HTML structure of your web application and dynamically updating the content.
filter() and map(): These array methods provide powerful ways to manipulate and transform data. You might use filter() to selectively display relevant posts based on user preferences or map() to create a new array of elements based on existing data (e.g., generating a list of user names).
